HC MID's web site is now hosted on github -- just like all of our editorial work! 

New content includes a "[Hall of Fame](http://hcmid.github.io/hof/)" page with links to conference papers, funded research, etc., and a new atom feed, <http://hcmid.github.io/atom.xml>, if you want to keep up with the latest from MID in that format.

(The theme is of course in Crusader purple.)
