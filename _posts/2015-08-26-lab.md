The St. Isidore of Seville Research lab in Fenwick 406 is home for a lot of HCMID's work.  Last week, the aging carpet in Fenwick 406 was replaced, and yesterday, the six client machines in the lab were upgraded with new iMacs.  Here's a brief summary of [resources available to club members there](http://hcmid.github.io/tech/), as Holy Cross students return to campus.  Are we missing anything you need for your HCMID projects?

Thanks to ITS and the Dean's office for our physical and digital home on campus, and to Physical Plant and the house keeping staff for keeping it in top physical shape.
