Congratulations to club members Claude Hanley, Stephanie Neville, Charlie Schufrieder and Alex Simrell on their presentation Saturday at the conference "[Collaborating Digitally: Engaging Students in Public Scholarship](https://dsconf.blogs.bucknell.edu)" at Bucknell University on Saturday.  Here's a link to the abstract of their talk on "[Digital Editions of Primary Documents: A Collaborative Modern Approach to Ancient Texts](http://dsconf.blogs.bucknell.edu/2015/09/14/digital-editions-of-primary-documents-a-collaborative-modern-approach-to-ancient-texts/)."

Put another point on the  "MID outside of Worcester" map!
