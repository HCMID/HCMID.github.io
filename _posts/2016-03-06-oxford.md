Nik Churik '15 spoke last week at the Oxford University Byzantine Society’s 18th International Graduate Conference, "Trends and Turning-Points: Constructing the Late Antique and Byzantine World (c. 300 – c. 1500)."  (Here is [the full program for the conference](https://oxfordbyzantinesociety.wordpress.com/international-graduate-conference-2016-2/).)

Nik's paper "Greek Explicating Greek:  A Study of Metaphrase Language and Style" grows out of work at did at Holy Cross as an MID member, and compares work he did last year on vocabulary and syntax of a Homeric paraphrase with other "metaphrases" of the *Iliad*.

The United Kingdom is now the eighth country where current and former MID members have presented work begun on the fourth floor of Fenwick Hall.  (See a [map of MID outside of Worcester](http://hcmid.github.io/where/).)
