On February 24, 2018, HC MID will take over the third floor of Hogan Center to host an all-day manuscript hackathon for secondary school students and teachers.

Club member Hannah Nguyen '19 has received funding from the Holy Cross [Ignite Fund](https://www.holycross.edu/center-liberal-arts-world/create-your-own-project) to make the event possible.

We'll collaborate on a digital diplomatic edition of Latin bestiary known as "the Bern Physiologus" (part of Bern Burgerbibliothek codex 318).  The final result will be published in the Holy Cross Library's Institutional Repository.


For more information, including how to register for the hackathon, see the [hackathon home page](https://hcmid.github.io/ms-hackathon-2018/).
