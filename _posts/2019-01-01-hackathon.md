We're offering another free manuscripts hackathon for secondary-school students of Latin and their teachers.  This year's event will take place on  Saturday, February 2, 2018, at Holy Cross' Hogan Center.

We'll collaborate on a digital diplomatic edition of a 9th-century manuscript with a beautifully illustrated poem about the constellations (Germanicus Caesarâ€™s *Aratea*.)  The final result will be published in the Holy Cross Library's Institutional Repository.


For more information, including how to register for the hackathon, see the [hackathon home page](https://hcmid.github.io/ms-hackathon-2019/).
