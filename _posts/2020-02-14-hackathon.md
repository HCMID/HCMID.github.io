We're offering our third annual free manuscripts hackathon for secondary-school students of Latin and their teachers tomorrow,  Saturday, February 15, 2020, at Holy Cross.


We'll try to complete a digital diplomatic edition of the cool 9th-century manuscript last year's team began: a beautifully illustrated poem about the constellations (Germanicus Caesarâ€™s *Aratea*.)  The final result will be submitted to a new publication series to be made availabe from the Holy Cross Library's Institutional Repository.
