Holy Cross has cancelled in-person classes, and will enter a "distance-learning" phase the week of Mar. 23-27.

> When Holy Cross courses are in session, HC MID is in session.

We are beginning plans to experiment with "distance-hacking" on manuscripts.  We'll open up for business on the first Friday when classes resume, March 27.

For now, we are staying in touch with a group chat on GroupMe and are planning to organize Google Meets for individual editing teams.  We'll post more on this blog as we work out new ways to collaborate remotely.
