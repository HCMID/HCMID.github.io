"Regular" HC MID work sessions resume on Friday, March 27, from 2:00-6:00 (?) eastern time.

We'll use Zoom to meet at [this Zoom meeting](https://holycross.zoom.us/j/583824838) (meeting ID: 583 824 838).  Zoom will let us organize work teams (that may change from week to week) in breakout rooms. With Zoom's "Annotate" sharing, we can easily point to or scribble on windows with images of manuscripts.  To prevent potential Zoombombing, meetings include a waiting room where participants can be added by a meeting host.


We will focus on integrating work on Burgerbibliothek 88 (Germanicus' *Aratea*) from our 2019 and 2020 manuscript hackathons in [this github repository](https://github.com/hcmid/germanicus).  ![Zoom!](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_001v.tif&RGN=0.5855,0.1069,0.3725,0.2979&wID=200&CVT=JPEG)
 We plan to validate our work to current MID standards including automated morphological parsing with manual disambiguation of the results.
