### Work until March 13

We planned to build on the work of HC MID's two previous manuscript hackathons to complete a digital diplomatic edition of Germanicus' *Aratea* in Bern, Burgerbiliothek 88.  (For more about the 2020 manuscripts hackthon, [see this overview](https://hcmid.github.io/academic_conference20/hackathon/) from Stacey Kaliabakos and Ryan Wynn.)  On this page, we summarize our work this spring, how we adapted once all of us left campus, and where we hope to take the project beyond this semester.



### Why a *diplomatic* edition of Bern 88 is interesting

- The manuscript differs, in its selection of content and its ordering of lines, from other manuscripts of the *Aratea*.
- The illustrations, and their relationship to the text, show a level of comprehension and engagement with the text on the part of the illustrator.
- A second reader annotated the manuscript, and offers a window into both the use of the manuscript, and the textual variation of the manuscript tradition.

To see on-going work defining editorial policies for the  project, see the [project wiki](https://github.com/HCMID/germanicus/wiki/Policies).




## Design and organization of the manuscript

### A visual "table of contents"

This illustration  on folio 11 verso serves both as a diagram of the relative positions of the constellations and as a guide to the text. The concentric green circles represent varying degrees of latitude on the celestial sphere. The orange ring shows the proceeding order of the zodiac.

### Image, Text, and Scholia As A Unit

![folio 2 recto](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_002r.tif&RGN=0.04273,0.5668,0.8731,0.2853&wID=5000&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: The text of the manuscript differs substantially in terms of ordering from other versions of the poem. Sections on each constellation have been moved around as though they function as individual units. The manuscript's outline reflects this grouping by positioning the text, scholion, and illustration for each constellation as a unit separate from the others.

### The Relationship Between Image and Scholia

**Hercules**
![folio 2 recto](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_002r.tif&RGN=0.06311,0.1148,0.2567,0.3633&wID=5000&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: The illustrations for each constellation depict the position and number of stars as outlined in the adjoining block of text, demonstrating the illustrator's comprehension of the “scholiastic” details. They also contained artistic representations of identifying mythological attributes (such as Hercules' lion pelt shown here).

**Hercules' Scholia**
![folio 2 recto](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_002r.tif&RGN=0.7079,0.3704,0.2008,0.08513&wID=5000&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: The scholia for each constellation formulaically starts with the name of each constellation, and it lists the number of stars in particular regions of the constellation.

### Illustration of A Second Pass
![folio 1 verso](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_001v.tif&RGN=0.2588,0.6507,0.4349,0.03449&wID=800&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: A second scribal pass offers textual variations that reflect different manuscript traditions and scribal corrections to the main text. In this example, the second hand adds an additional line to the passage, and as seen in the first word of the line, offers an orthographic variation.

### Validating Work

-Validation allows us to maintain consistent editorial standards and ensures that the text is encoded in a manner that is conducive to digital analysis.
-Verification allows us to weed out errors in transcription and association, and checks our documentation of the text.


### Work after March 13
