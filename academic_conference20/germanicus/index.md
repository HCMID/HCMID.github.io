We planned to build on the work of HC MID's two previous manuscript hackathons to complete a digital diplomatic edition of Germanicus' *Aratea* in Bern, Burgerbiliothek 88.  (For more about the 2020 manuscripts hackthon, [see this overview](https://hcmid.github.io/academic_conference20/hackathon/) from Stacey Kaliabakos and Ryan Wynn.)  



In part 1, we present some of the reasons a diplomatic edition of the Bern manuscript is important, based on work we were able to complete both before and after we left campus this spring.

In part 2, we describe our ongoing work to bring this project to a publishable standard.
