## Preparing a digital edition of Germanicus' *Aratea*


### Work until March 13



### Why a *diplomatic* edition is interesting

- The manuscript differs, in both content and ordering of lines, from other editions of the *Aratea*.
- The illustrations, and their relationship to the text, show a level of comprehension and engagement with the text on the part of the illustrator.
- The second pass offers a window into the editorial process, and the textual variation of the manuscript edition.

To see on-going work defining editorial policies for the  project, see the [project wiki](https://github.com/HCMID/germanicus/wiki/Policies).



### Work after March 13

- ways to continue team editing
- future plans

## Illustrations

### Table of Contents

![folio 11 verso](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_011v.tif&RGN=0.1950,0.1453,0.8012,0.6064&wID=5000&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: The "table of contents" of this manuscript also serves as a scientific diagram of the relative positions of the constellations as well as a guide to the text. The concentric green circles roughly represent varying degrees of latitude with the inner circles outlining the northern hemisphere. The orange ring shows the proceeding order of the zodiac.

### Image, Text, and Scholia As A Unit

![folio 2 recto](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_002r.tif&RGN=0.04273,0.5668,0.8731,0.2853&wID=5000&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: The text of the manuscript differs substantially in terms of ordering from other versions of the poem. Sections on each constellation have been moved around as though they function as individual units. The manuscript's outline reflects this grouping by positioning the text, scholion, and illustration for each constellation as a unit separate from the others.

### The Relationship Between Image and Scholia

**Hercules**
![folio 2 recto](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_002r.tif&RGN=0.06311,0.1148,0.2567,0.3633&wID=5000&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: The illustrations for each constellation depict the position and number of stars as outlined in the adjoining block of text, demonstrating the illustrator's comprehension of the “scholiastic” details. They also contained artistic representations of identifying mythological attributes (such as Hercules' lion pelt shown here).

**Hercules' Scholia**
![folio 2 recto](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_002r.tif&RGN=0.7079,0.3704,0.2008,0.08513&wID=5000&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: The scholia for each constellation formulaically starts with the name of each constellation, and it lists the number of stars in particular regions of the constellation.

### Illustration of A Second Pass
![folio 1 verso](http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?OBJ=IIP,1.0&FIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/ecod/bern88imgs/v1/bern88_001v.tif&RGN=0.2588,0.6507,0.4349,0.03449&wID=800&CVT=JPEG)
Caption: A second scribal pass offers textual variations that reflect different manuscript traditions and scribal corrections to the main text. In this example, the second hand adds an additional line to the passage, and as seen in the first word of the line, offers an orthographic variation.

### Validating Work

-Validation allows us to maintain consistent editorial standards and ensures that the text is encoded in a manner that is conducive to digital analysis.
-Verification allows us to weed out errors in transcription and association, and checks our documentation of the text.
