## Distance-hacking manuscripts with HC MID

We're set to get started!

## Focus for S20

We will integrate work on Burgerbibliothek 88 (Germanicus' *Aratea*) from our 2019 and 2020 manuscript hackathons in [this github repository](https://github.com/hcmid/germanicus).  We plan to validate our work to current MID standards including automated morphological parsing with manual disambiguation of the results.



## Zoom meetings

On Fridays, from 2:00-6:00 (?) eastern time, we will use Zoom to meet at [this Zoom meeting](https://holycross.zoom.us/j/583824838) (meeting ID: 583 824 838).

You can add our meetings to your calendar by downloading and importing [this iCalendar (`.ics`) file](https://holycross.zoom.us/meeting/uJwuf-uspjgiharDd8E_0AW6Q5hzGOtyHg/ics?icsToken=98tyKuygrTMoHtyWuFz9RbMvW5n-bvHmi3lPuIdZxDraUwFkNDKjPvhlHaZmON-B)
