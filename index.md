## Distance-hacking manuscripts with HC MID


## Academic Conference, 2020

For this year's academic conference, we are presenting some of our work in [these web pages](academic_conference20/).


## Focus for S20

We have integrated work on Burgerbibliothek 88 (Germanicus' *Aratea*) from our 2019 and 2020 manuscript hackathons in [this github repository](https://github.com/hcmid/germanicus).  We are currently completing editing of the text and scholia, and are validating our work to current MID standards.  We plan to add automated morphological parsing with manual disambiguation of the results.



## Zoom meetings

On Fridays, from 2:00-6:00 (?) eastern time, we will use Zoom to meet at [this Zoom meeting](https://holycross.zoom.us/j/583824838) (meeting ID: `583 824 838`).
