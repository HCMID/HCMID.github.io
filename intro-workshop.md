## Overview

From 3:00-5:00 in Levis Browsing Room (basement of Dinand Library), we'll walk you through the full process of editing a manuscript.  Everyone is welcome:  there are no prerequisites of any kind.

Projects you can choose to work on include:

-  the original parchment text of the Declaration of Independence, vs. the most frequently seen facsimile (both in English)
-  a ninth-century Latin manuscript natural and allegorial descriptions of a variety of animals

## Before the workshop

-  If you can bring your own laptop, you can [download the software we'll use ahead of time](../tech/software).
-  If you'd like help configuring your laptop, we'll have an install fest the hour before the workshop (2:00-3:00) in Fenwick 420.

If you can't bring your own laptop, come anyway:  we do all our work in teams, and will match you up with someone who has a working system.
