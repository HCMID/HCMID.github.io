title: File naming conventions
layout: page

-  *never* include white space in file names
-  start file names with lower case.  You may either use camel-case spelling or hyphens to make it easier to read multiword names.  Examples:
    -    camel-case:  `pageToImageIndex.cex`
    -    hypens: `page-to-image-index.cex`
-  use these filename extensions:
    -   for markdown files:  `.md`
    -   for XML files:  `.xml`
    -   for structured text documents in CEX format: `.cex`
