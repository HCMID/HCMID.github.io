title: The St. Isidore Research Lab
---

The St. Isidore of Seville Research Lab in Fenwick 406 hosts a local area network with two servers and six client computers.  The two servers are visible on the internet;  the client machines are not.

## Resources available to club members ##

Club members may use the shared `oxygen` user account on any of the client computers.  These are iMacs installed in the lab in August, 2015.  Club members may also request a user account on <http://shot.holycross.edu>.   You have access to and can use your files on `shot` from any of the client computers in the lab.  All content on `shot` is backed up once an hour.

### Client machines: the `oxygen` account ###

In addition to standard Mac OS X applications including a terminal for running a `bash` shell and TextEdit for simple text editing, the shared `oxygen` account on the client machines includes:


- [Atom](https://atom.io/) configured for editing tabular data, TEI XML, Markdown and code
- [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), a "universal document converter"
- [sophokeys](http://www.benjaminblonder.org/sophokeys/), a polytonic Greek keyboard input method.  (The `oxygen` account is configured to use command-space as a shortcut for cycling through keyboard input methods.)
- [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) for typesetting with LaTex
- Openly licensed fonts including a selection from the [Greek Font Society](http://www.greekfontsociety.gr/)
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for bitmapped graphics
- Inkscape for vector graphics
- [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/)  for composing musical scores




### Client machines: the `classics` account ###

The client machines have an account named `classics` with administrative privileges.  Authorized lab monitors and other members of the club who are helping maintain the lab may also be given access to the `classics` account.
