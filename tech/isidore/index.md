title: The St. Isidore Research Lab
---

The St. Isidore of Seville Research Lab in Fenwick 406 hosts a local area network with two servers and six client computers.  The two servers are visible on the internet;  the client machines are not.

## Resources available to club members ##

Club members may use the shared `oxygen` user account on any of the client computers.  These are iMacs installed in the lab in August, 2015.  Club members may also request a user account on <http://shot.holycross.edu>.   You have access to and can use your files on `shot` from any of the client computers in the lab.  All content on `shot` is backed up once an hour.
