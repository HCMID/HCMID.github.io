title: The St. Isidore Research Lab
---

The St. Isidore of Seville Research Lab in Fenwick 406 hosts a local area network with two servers and six client computers.  The two servers are visible on the internet;  the client machines are not.

## Resources available to club members ##

Club members may use the shared `oxygen` user account on any of the client computers.  These are iMacs installed in the lab in August, 2015.  Club members may also request a user account on <http://shot.holycross.edu>.   You have access to and can use your files on `shot` from any of the client computers in the lab.  All content on `shot` is backed up once an hour.

### Client machines: the `oxygen` account ###

In addition to standard Mac OS X applications including a teminal for running a `bash` shell and TextEdit for simple text editing, the shared `oxygen` account on the client machines includes:

- a licensed copy of the oXygen XML Editor
- [LightPaper](http://www.ashokgelal.com/lightpaper-for-mac/) for editing Markdown
- [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), a "universal document converter"
- [sophokeys](http://www.benjaminblonder.org/sophokeys/), a polytonic Greek keyboard input method.  (The `oxygen` account is configured to use command-space as a shortcut for cycling through keyboard input methods.)
- Firefox web browser with the [alpheios text tools for Greek and Latin](http://alpheios.net/content/user-guide)
- R and RStudio for statistics
- Gimp for bitmapped graphics
- Inkscape for vector graphics

- Vagrant and VirtualBox for running virtual machines
- rubygems and jekyll for developing and testing web sites written in markdown


### Client machines: the `classics` account ###

The client machines have an account named `classics` with administrative privileges.  Authorized lab monitors and other members of the club who are helping maintain the lab may also be given access to the `classics` account.
