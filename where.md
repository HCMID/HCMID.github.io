title: MID outside of Worcester
---


In addition to our regular work at Holy Cross (including presentations at the annual [Academic Conference](../hof/hcacad), and [hosting guest speakers](../hosted)), MID members have spoken at a wide range of conferences outside of Worcester.

Click a marker on the map for details about a presentation.  You'll have to zoom in quite a bit to see the different locations in Washington, DC, and in greater Boston where club members have presented at a number of events.
